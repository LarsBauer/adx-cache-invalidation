# Adxstudio Portal Cache Invalidation
Adxstudio Portal makes use of caching to optimize performance and reduce requests to Dynamics CRM. Therefore changes made to the website in the CRM system won't show up immediately. This can be resolved by making a HTTP Request to the cache-invalidation handler. This web extension will add a button to your browser toolbar which calls the cache-invalidation handler of the current portal and reloads the page to reflect the latests changes.
